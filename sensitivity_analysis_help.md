**How to Read These Charts:**

These charts explore trade-offs. You can see how retiring earlier/later or spending more/less affects your plan's success.

- **Green is good:** High chance of success.
- **Red is risky:** High chance of running out of money.

*Example:* If the center square (your current plan) is yellow, look at the squares around it. A green square at (+2 years, -10k) means you could greatly increase your success rate by retiring 2 years later and spending $10k less per year.
